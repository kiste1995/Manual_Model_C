Explanation
=============

Our zeta bot is equipped with 2 internal motors, an arduino circuit for controlling them
as well as jackson nano to act as the main brain of the robot. 

When we execute a function from our jupyter notebook, the command is sent to 
the jackson board which sends the command to an arduino processor mounted on
our board. This then sends the motors instructions to how to move. 


Use use ``rospy`` library to communicate with our robot and send instructions to. 
By creating a object using the rospy Publisher class, we can send 
jason strings to the robot. 


With our robot now recieving instructions and moving we may also 
display Odometry infromation. 

Odometry Information
----------------------

In robotics, estimating the positional information relative to a 
starting location is called the **odometry**. We may estimate 
where our robot is relative to its starting position using the 
feedback information from our motors. 

Odometry information may also help in navigational tasks and other
self driving applications.
