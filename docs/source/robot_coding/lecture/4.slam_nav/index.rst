SLAM and Navigation 
====================


Within our day to day life, navigation system system is understood as somthing akin to GPS navigation. It allows for us to 
see where we are in relation to our surroundings and can direct where to go to reach our desired destination. 

When it comes to navigation within robotics, it is the movement of the robot to a determined destination. For this 
we would need to know where our robot is, what our surroundings look like (map), the optimal route and a way to avoid 
obstacles.
