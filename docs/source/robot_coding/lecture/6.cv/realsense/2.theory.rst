Depth Camera Theory
======================


Without the need for special distance sensors such as laser distance detector,
there are ways to differentiate depth using cameras. 
Biggest example of this is humans. By using two visual sources, we can calculate
how far an object is in relation to the host. Similar to this, depth camera utilizes
stereo camera set up to calculate the distance of an object.
