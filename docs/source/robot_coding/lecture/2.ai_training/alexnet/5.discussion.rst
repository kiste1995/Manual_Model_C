Both GoogleNet and AlexNet image recognition system can identify an object, but they cannot identify multiple objects.

                How can image recognition system be improved so that it can detect multiple objects? What kinds of methods do you think the system would need? There might be:
                <ul>
                    <li>Object localization System</li>
                    <li>Segmentation System</li>
                    <li>Augmentation System</li>
                    <li>Object Tracking</li>
                    <li>etc.,</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> 
                Why would we need to detect multiple objects within a screen? Where would this system be implemented?
