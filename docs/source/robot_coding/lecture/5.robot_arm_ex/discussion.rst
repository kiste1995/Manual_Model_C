                If you could improve the robot arm movement system, how would you move it?
                <ul>
                    <li>Currently, when we move our robot arm we only use 1 of the specified motor servos. When we command our robot arm to reach down, it does not utilize all of the arm servos. How can we adjust our software so that it utilizes all of the servos? Would it improve the movement?</li>
