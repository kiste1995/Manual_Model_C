Universal Scene Description
=============================


Universal Scene Description (USD) is an open an extensible exosystem for describing, composing, simulating, 
and collaborating within 3D simulated worlds, originally invented by Pixar Animation Studios.

With its design and features, the USD has quickly become the industry stanard for 3D project format. It contains
important fundamental tools and capabilities accelarting workflows, teams, and projects on a large scale. 

**Benifits of USD format**


- USD file format allows for open, extensive framework and ecosystem that contains many APIs from composing, editing, 
querying, rendering, collaborating, and simulation within 3D virtual worlds. 

- Our project leans in favor for team collaborative works. The USD enables non-destructive workflows and collaboration in scene creation
  and asset afregation so teams can iterate collaboratively. 

- USD supports custom renderers in a generalized pipeline thanks to its Hydra rendering architecture that provides flexibility in visualizing data. 
- USD supports any data storage model allowing for disparate data sources.  


Within our project the USD file format is used within the Isaac Sim developed within the Omniverse environment. 
Which ever figures or environment made within the Isaac Sim may be saved in USD file format. And any USD file format 
may be loaded into the environment.
