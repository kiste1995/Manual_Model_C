                If you were to apply this system to a consumer product, what kind of product would that be? For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Foot Traffic Analysis</li>
                    <li>Airport Security System</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> If you could improve or add a feature onto Detect Object system, what would it be?</li>
        </ul>
